# Proportions

## Confidence intrval

Task:

* We take a sample of 1,000 voters.

* 45% of our respondents say they will vote for trump.

* Provide an interval with 95% of containing the true proportion $p$

Solution:

Our proportion $\hat{p}$ follows a normal distribution with mean $p$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{p(1-p)/N} \approx \sqrt{0.45\times 0.55/1000} \approx 0.016$

Lets consider symmetric intervals with: $[\hat{p} - B, \hat{p} + B]$

We want to find a _margin of error_ $\text{MOE}$ such that:

$$
\text{P}(p \in [\hat{p} - \text{MOE}, \hat{p} + \text{MOE}]) = 0.95
$$

We accomplish it by setting $\text{MOE} = 1.96 \sigma_{\hat{p}} \approx 1.96\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}/\sqrt{N} \approx 0.03$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{P}(p \in [\hat{p} - 2 \sigma_{\hat{p}}, \hat{p} + 2 \sigma_{\hat{p}}]) &= \text{P}(\hat{p} -  2 \sigma_{\hat{p}} < p < \hat{p} +  2 \sigma_{\hat{p}}]) \\
&= \text{P}(-  2 \sigma_{\hat{p}} < \hat{p} - p < 2 \sigma_{\hat{p}}])\\
&= \text{P}\left(-  2  < \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}} < 2\right)\\
&= \text{P}(-2 < Z < 2)\\
&=0.95
\end{aligned}
$$


So our interval is $0.45 \pm 0.03$.

* If we want to be 99.7% sure we can use 3 instead of 2.

* If we want to be 68% sure we can use 1 instead of 2.

We refer to the 0.03 as the _margin of error_ (MOE).

## Critical values

We already knew that using $2$ would give us a 95% confidence interval.

But what if we didn't know? Or if we wanted a 99% confidence interval?

The function `invNorm` will do this for us. The impute is the area to the left. 

So to obtain 95% we need 0.5% to the left and 0..5% to the right.

We use `invNorm(0.995)` which gives us `r qnorm(0.995)`

So we multiply by $2.57$ not $2$ to get a 99% confidence interval.

Note that to get exactly 95% we actually use `invNorm(0.975)` which is `r qnorm(0.975)`, a little bit less than 2. In some books you will see 1.96 instead of 2.

## p-values


* We want to know if a coin in biased.

* We toss it 100 times and observe 60% heads.

Is it biased or can this happen by chance? 

Let's compute the probability of seeing $\hat{p} = 0.6$ or more extreme.

Note that 0.4 is as extreme: we usually permit both directions.

Null hypothesis: It is fair or $p=0.5$

We will reject if the _p-value_ is 0.05 or smaller.

The p-value is the probability observing something as extreme as we did when the null hypothesis holds

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{P}(|\hat{p} - p| \geq 0.1) &= 1 - \text{P}(|\hat{p} - p| < 0.1)\\
&=1 - \text{P}\left(\left|\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}\right| < \frac{0.1}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}\right)\\
&=1 - \text{P}\left(|Z| < \frac{0.1}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

When the null hypothesis holds, $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{0.5\times 0.5 / 100} = 0.05$

So the p-value is $1 - \text{P}(|Z| < 0.1/0.05 = 1.96)$ which is a bit less than 0.05

We reject the null hypothesis.

## Type of errors

* Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. Example say the coin is biased when it was fair.

* Type II error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is not true. Example saying the coin is fair when it was biased.

* Power is the 1 - probability of Type II error.

## Difference of two proportion


### Confidence interval

* Does drug work better than placebo?

* The proportion of the populations are $p_1$ and $p_2$.

* For both placebo and drugged populations we obtain sample means $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$

* The sample sizes are $N_1$ and $N_2$

* Provide a 95% confidence interval

We know the difference $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ had the following mean and SD:

* $\mu_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = p_1 - p_2$
* $\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{N_1} + \frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{N_2}}$


To construct a 95% confidence interval we use 
$\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 \pm \sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}$

As before we estimate 

$$
\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} =  \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{N_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{N_2}}
$$


### p-value

* Suppose we have sample sizes of 25 and 100 for the the drug and placebo group respectively and 

* we observe $\hat{p}_1 = 0.25$ and $\hat{p}_2 = 0.15$

* The null is that there is no difference so $p_1 - p_2$ or $p_1 = p_2 = p$

Under the null hypothesis we have

* $\mu_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = 0$

* $\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{ \frac{p(1-p)}{N_1} + \frac{p(1-p)}{N_2}}$


To compute the p-value we need an estimate for $\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2}$  which depends on $p$

We estimate  $p$ with pooled data:

$$\frac{N_1\hat{p}_1 + N_2\hat{p}_2}{N_1+N_2} = 0.17$$ 

which means $\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2} \approx \sqrt{(0.17\times 0.83)(1/25+1/100)} \approx 0.08$


With this we can compute

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{P}(|\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2| \geq 0.1) &= 1 - \text{P}(|Z| < 0.1/\sigma_{\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2})\\
&= 1 - \text{P}(|Z| < 0.1/0.08) \\
&\approx 0.20
\end{aligned}
$$

We do not reject.


### Confidence interval and p-value connection

You can do the math and see that **if a 95% confidence interval does not include the null hypothesis mean, then a p-value will be less than 0.05**

The math:

If the null hypothesis says the mean is $p$ and the observed $\hat{p}$ resulted in a p-value less than 0.05, we know:


$$
\left| \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\sigma_{\hat{p}}} \right| > 2
$$
This implies that either

$$
p > \hat{p} + 2\sigma_{\hat{p}} \text{ or } p < \hat{p} - 2\sigma_{\hat{p}}
$$
