# Goodness of fit

### Example:  

Are all color Skittles equally likely?

Here is the dat?

| Color   | Observed Count |
|---------|----------------|
| Red     | 20             |
| Yellow  | 25             |
| Green   | 15             |
| Purple  | 18             |
| Orange  | 22             |
| **Total** | **100**      |

We see more yellow and less green? 

Can this happen by chance?

## Chi-square test

This is a **goodness of fit** test.

If we have $k$ categories each with $p_i$, $i=1,\dots,k$ and observe $N$ outcomes, we expect to seen $E_i = N p_i$ of each.

If we observe $O_i$ for categories $i=1,\dots,k$ then the distribution of

$$
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}
$$

follows what is called a chi-square distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom.

### Example:  

Getting back to our example, if equally likely we have

$$
E_i = 100/5 \approx 20
$$

for all categories.

We can compute the $\chi^2$ stat by

$$
\left((20 - 20)^2 + (25 - 20)^2 + (15 - 20)^2 + (18 - 20)^2 + (22 - 20)^2\right)/20 = 2.8
$$

We can look up this probability for a $\chi^2$ with 4 degrees of freedom and see that the p-value is 0.6. 

So can easilty see this by chance.

## Example


Is promotion status **independent** of gender, or is there evidence of **gender bias**?

Observed Data:

| Gender | Promoted | Not Promoted | Total |
|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Men    | 45       | 55           | 100   |
| Women  | 30       | 70           | 100   |
| **Total** | **75**   | **125**         | **200**   |

Calculate expected counts under the assumption of independence:

$$
E_{ij} = \frac{(\text{row total}) \times (\text{column total})}{\text{grand total}}
$$

| Gender | Promoted | Not Promoted |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Men    | $\frac{100 \times 75}{200} = 37.5$ | $\frac{100 \times 125}{200} = 62.5$ |
| Women  | $37.5$     | $62.5$          |


Compute the chi-square test statistic:

$$
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E} = \frac{(45 - 37.5)^2}{37.5} + \frac{(55 - 62.5)^2}{62.5} + \frac{(30 - 37.5)^2}{37.5} + \frac{(70 - 62.5)^2}{62.5}
$$

$$
= \frac{56.25}{37.5} + \frac{56.25}{62.5} + \frac{56.25}{37.5} + \frac{56.25}{62.5} = 1.5 + 0.9 + 1.5 + 0.9 = \mathbf{4.8}
$$


This has 1 degree of freedom.

Use the chi-square cumulative distribution function:

$$
P(\chi^2 \geq 4.8) \approx 0.028
$$


Since the p-value is approximately 0.028, which is less than the typical significance level of 0.05, we **reject $H_0$**.

:::{.callout-important}
In the test there will be two types of problems related ti goodness of fit:

* Is the distribution of categorial data as expected (for example, Skittles)?
  * Several categories $k$
  * probabilities of each category given
  * degrees of freedom is $k-1$
  
* Are two variables independent (for example, gender bias)?
  * Two categories
  * proportions calculated are from data.
  * degrees of freedom is 1.
